# ACID Stand for

- `Atomicity` : All operations will either succeed or fail to gether
- `Consistency` : All changes made by operations are consistent with database constraints
- `Isolation` : Multiple transactions can happen at the same time without affecting the outcome of the other transaction
-  `Durability` : All of the changes that are made by operations in a transaction will persist, no matter what
